<p>True or false, and state why:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The significance level of a statistical test is equal to the probability that the
null hypothesis is true.</li>
<li>If the significance level of a test is decreased, the power of the test would be expected to
increase.</li>
<li>The probability that the null hypothesis is falsely rejected is equal to the power
of the test.</li>
<li>A type I error occurs when the test statistic falls in the rejection region of the
test.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>A coin is thrown independently 10 times to test the hypothesis that the probability of heads is <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> versus the alternative that the probability is not <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span>. The test rejects
if either 0 or 10 heads are observed.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the significance level of the test?</li>
<li>If in fact the probability of heads is <span class="math inline">\(0.1\)</span>, what is the power of the test?</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(X_1,X_2,X_3\)</span> are samples of Bernoulli <span class="math inline">\(B(1,p)\)</span> population. For testing the hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0:p=1/2\ vs.\ H_1:p=3/4\)</span>, we use a rejection region:
<span class="math display">\[W=\{(x_1,x_2,x_3):x_1+x_2+x_3\ge 2\}.\]</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What are the probabilities of the two types of errors for <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>?</li>
<li>What is the power of the test? Graph the power as a function of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
