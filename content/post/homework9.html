<p>Consider the linear model
<span class="math display">\[y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1x_i+\epsilon_i,\ \epsilon_i\stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0,\sigma^2), i=1,\dots,n.\]</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Derive the maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) for <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0,\beta_1\)</span>. Are they consistent with the least square estimators (LSE)?</p></li>
<li><p>Derive the MLE for <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> and look at its unbiasedness.</p></li>
<li><p>A very slippery point is whether to treat the <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> as fixed numbers or as random variables. In the class, we treated the predictors <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> as fixed numbers for sake of convenience. Now suppose that the predictors <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> are iid random variables (independent of <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span>) with density <span class="math inline">\(f_X(x;\theta)\)</span> for some parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. Write down the likelihood function for all of our data <span class="math inline">\((x_i,y_i),i=1,\dots,n\)</span>. Derive the MLE for <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0,\beta_1\)</span> and see whether the MLE changes if we work with the setting of random predictors?</p></li>

<hr />
<p>Consider the linear model without intercept</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y_i  = \beta x_i+\epsilon_i,\ i=1,\dots,n,\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span> are independent with <span class="math inline">\(E[\epsilon_i]=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Var[\epsilon_i]=\sigma^2\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Write down the least square estimator <span class="math inline">\(\hat \beta\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, and derive an unbiased estiamtor for <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>For fixed <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>, let <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}_0=\hat\beta x_0\)</span>. Work out <span class="math inline">\(Var[\hat{y}_0]\)</span>.</p></li>

<p><code>Case study</code>: Genetic variability is thought to be a key factor in the survival of a species, the idea
being that “diverse” populations should have a better chance of coping with changing
environments. Table below summarizes the results of a study designed to test
that hypothesis experimentally. Two populations of fruit flies (Drosophila serrata)-one that was cross-bred (Strain A) and the other,
in-bred (Strain B)-were put into sealed containers where food and space were kept
to a minimum. Recorded every hundred days were the numbers of Drosophila alive
in each population.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Plot day numbers versus population sizes for Strain A and Strain B, respectively. Does the plot look linear? If so, please use least squares to figure out the coefficients and
their standard errors, and plot the two regression lines.</p></li>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1^*\)</span> be the true slopes (i.e., growth rates) for Strain A and Strain B, respectively. Assume the population sizes for the two strains are independent. Under the same assumptions of <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0,\sigma^2)\)</span> for both strains, do we have enough evidence here
to reject the null hypothesis that <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\le \beta_1^*\)</span> (significance level <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.05\)</span>)? Or equivalently, do these data support the theory that genetically mixed populations have a
better chance of survival in hostile environments.</p></li>
