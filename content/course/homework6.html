<p>True or false, and state why:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The significance level of a statistical test is equal to the probability that the
null hypothesis is true.</li>
<li>If the significance level of a test is decreased, the power of the test would be expected to
increase.</li>
<li>The probability that the null hypothesis is falsely rejected is equal to the power
of the test.</li>
<li>A type I error occurs when the test statistic falls in the rejection region of the
test.</li>
</ol>
<!-- 

`Solution`: 

1. `FALSE`. The significance level is the (tight) upper bound of the probability of type I error. It has nothing to do with the conclusion "the null hypothesis is true".

2. `FALSE`. If the significance level of a test is decreased, the probability of type II error would be expected to increase. This implies that the power of the test would be decreased.


3. `FALSE`. The probability that the null hypothesis is falsely rejected is equal to the probability of type I error.

4. `FALSE`. A type I error occurs when the test statistic falls in the rejection region of the test and **the null is true**.

<p>A coin is thrown independently 10 times to test the hypothesis that the probability of heads is <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> versus the alternative that the probability is not <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span>. The test rejects
if either 0 or 10 heads are observed.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the significance level of the test?</li>
<li>If in fact the probability of heads is <span class="math inline">\(0.1\)</span>, what is the power of the test?</li>
</ol>
<!-- 
`Solution`: Let $\theta$ be the probability of heads. We are testing 
$$H_0:\theta=1/2\ vs.\ H_1:\theta\neq 1/2.$$
Denote $S$ as the number of heads. The rejection region is 
$W=\{S=0 \text{ or }10\}$. Under $H_0$, we have $S\sim B(10,1/2)$.

1. The significance level of the test is
$$\alpha = P(W|\theta=0.5) = P(S=0|\theta=0.5)+P(S=10|\theta=0.5)=2^{-10}+2^{-10}=2^{-9}.$$

2. The power of the test is
$$\rho_W(0.1) = P(W|\theta=0.1) = 0.1^{10}+0.9^{10}=0.349.$$

<p>Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(X_1,X_2,X_3\)</span> are samples of Bernoulli <span class="math inline">\(B(1,p)\)</span> population. For testing the hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0:p=1/2\ vs.\ H_1:p=3/4\)</span>, we use a rejection region:
<span class="math display">\[W=\{(x_1,x_2,x_3):x_1+x_2+x_3\ge 2\}.\]</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What are the probabilities of the two types of errors for <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>?</li>
<li>What is the power of the test? Graph the power as a function of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<!-- 
`Solution`: Let $S=X_1+X_2+X_3$. 

1. Under $H_0$, $S\sim B(3,1/2)$. The probability of type I error is 
$$\alpha = P(S\ge 2|p=1/2)=C_3^22^{-3}+C_3^32^{-3}=0.5.$$
Under $H_1$, $S\sim B(3,3/4)$. The probability of type II error is 
$$\beta = P(S< 2|p=3/4)=C_3^0(1/4)^{3}+C_3^1(3/4)(1/4)^2=\frac 5{32}.$$

2. The power of the test is $1-\beta=27/32$. The power function is
$$\rho_W(p) = P(S\ge 2) = C_3^2p^2(1-p)+C_3^3p^3=3p^2-2p^3.$$

```r
p = seq(0,1,by=0.001)
power = 3*p^2-2*p^3
par(mar=c(4,4,1,1))
plot(p,power,type="l")
```
