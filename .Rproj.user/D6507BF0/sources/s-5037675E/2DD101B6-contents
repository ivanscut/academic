```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

True or false, and state why:

1. The generalized likelihood ratio statistic $\lambda(\vec x)$ (see P.87 of our textbook) is always greater than or equal to 1.

2. If the p-value is 0.03, the corresponding test will reject at the significance
level 0.02.

3. If a test rejects at significance level 0.06, then the p-value is less than or equal
to 0.06.

4. The p-value of a test is the probability that the null hypothesis is correct.

5. In testing a simple versus simple hypothesis via the likelihood ratio test, the
p-value equals the inverse of the  likelihood ratio.

`Case study 1`: Mutual funds are investment vehicles consisting of a portfolio of various types
of investments. If such an investment is to meet annual spending needs, the
owner of shares in the fund is interested in the average of the annual returns of
the fund. Investors are also concerned with the volatility of the annual returns,
measured by the variance or standard deviation. One common method of evaluating
a mutual fund is to compare it to a benchmark, the Lipper Average being
one of these. This index number is the average of returns from a universe of
mutual funds.
The Global Rock Fund is a typical mutual fund, with heavy investments in
international funds. It claimed to best the Lipper Average in terms of volatility
over the period from 1989 through 2007. Its returns are given in the table below.


Year | Investment Return % | Year |  Investment Return %
 - | - | - | - |
1989  | 15.32 | 1999 | 27.43
1990  | 1.62  | 2000  | 8.57
1991  |  28.43 | 2001  | 1.88
1992  | 11.91  | 2002  | −7.96
1993  | 20.71  | 2003  | 35.98
1994  | −2.15  | 2004  | 14.27
1995  | 23.29  | 2005  | 10.33
1996  | 15.96  | 2006  | 15.94
1997  | 11.12  | 2007  | 16.71
1998  | 0.37 | |

The standard deviation for the Lipper Average is $11.67\%$. Let $\sigma^2$ denote the variance of the population represented by the return
percentages shown in the table above. Consider the test
$$H_0: \sigma^2=(11.67)^2\ vs.\ H_1:\sigma^2<(11.67)^2.$$
 

- If the significance level $\alpha=0.05$, what's your decision?

- Show up the p-value of your test.

`Case study 2`: Forensic scientists sometimes have difficulty identifying the sex of a murder
victim whose body is discovered badly decomposed. Often, dental structure can
provide useful clues because female teeth and male teeth have different physical and chemical characteristics. The extent to which X-rays can penetrate tooth
enamel, for instance, is not the same for the two sexes.

Table below lists the enamel spectropenetration gradients for eight male
teeth and eight female teeth. These measurements have all the characteristics
of the two-sample format: the data are quantitative, the units are similar,
two factor levels (male and female) are involved, and the observations are
independent.

Male | Female |
-|-|
4.9 |  4.8 | 
5.4  | 5.3 | 
5.0  | 3.7 | 
5.5  | 4.1 | 
5.4  | 5.6 | 
6.6  | 4.0 | 
6.3  | 3.6 | 
4.3  | 5.0 | 

Assume that the enamel spectropenetration gradients for male teeth and female teeth are normally distributed. Based on the data above, conduct a test (the significance level $\alpha=0.05$) to judge whether female teeth and male teeth have different physical and chemical characteristics. 


- Assume that their variances are the same, what's your decision?

- If you were not able to have the prior information that their variances are the same, what would you do? This is the case of **Behrens-Fisher Problem**. 

- The data are paired. Is it possible to do a paired test, without judging whether their variances are the same?

`Case study 3`: The National Center for Health Statistics (1970) gives the following data on
distribution of suicides in the United States by month in 1970. Is there any
evidence that the suicide rate varies seasonally, or are the data consistent with
the hypothesis that the rate is constant (the significance level $\alpha=0.05$)? (Hint: Under the latter hypothesis, model
the number of suicides in each month as a multinomial random variable with the
appropriate probabilities and conduct a goodness-of-fit test.)

Month | Number of Suicides | Days/Month |
-|-|-|
Jan.  | 1867  | 31
Feb.  | 1789  | 28
Mar.  | 1944  | 31
Apr.  | 2094  | 30
May  | 2097  | 31
June  | 1981  | 30
July  | 1887  | 31
Aug.  | 2024  | 31
Sept.  | 1928  | 30
Oct.  | 2032  | 31
Nov.  | 1978  | 30
Dec.  | 1859  | 31

`Case study 4`: Under (the assumption of) simple Mendelian inheritance, a cross
between plants of two particular genotypes produces progeny 1/4 of
which are "dwarf" and $3/4$ of which are "giant", respectively.
In an experiment to determine if this assumption is reasonable, a
cross results in progeny having 243 dwarf and 682 giant plants.
If "giant" is taken as success, the null hypothesis is that $p =3/4$ and the alternative that $p \neq 3/4$. 

- Let $X_i,i=1,\dots,n$ be the sample of the population $B(1,p)$. By central limit theorem (CLT), the distribution of $\bar X$ can be approximated by a normal distribution $N(p,p(1-p)/n)$. Please use this approximation to do the binominal test above.

- Actually, we can do the exact binominal test according to the formula given in P.114 of our textbook.  Compare the results in the exact test and the approximate test for significance  levels $\alpha=0.05,0.01,0.001$.
